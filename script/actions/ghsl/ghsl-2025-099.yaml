# GHSL-2025-099: Code injection via workflow_run head_branch
# https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-099_cross-platform-actions_action/
#
# Vulnerability: The head_branch is user-controlled and can contain malicious code
# when an attacker creates a PR with a specially crafted branch name.
#
# Attack vector:
# 1. Attacker creates a PR with branch name: `$(malicious_command)`
# 2. CI workflow runs on pull_request
# 3. This workflow_run triggers and executes the malicious branch name
