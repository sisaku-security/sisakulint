# GHSA-h3qr-39j9-4r5v: gradle/gradle-build-action secrets in cache
# Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3qr-39j9-4r5v
# Affected Action: gradle/gradle-build-action
# Vulnerability Type: Secrets Cached and Accessible to Untrusted Contexts
# Safe Pattern: Use cache-read-only or disable configuration cache with secrets

name: GHSA-h3qr-39j9-4r5v Safe Pattern
on:
  # Use pull_request instead of pull_request_target for untrusted PR validation
  # This prevents untrusted PR code from accessing secrets
  pull_request:

jobs:
  safe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Safe: Use cache-read-only for untrusted contexts
      # Prevents secrets from being written to cache
      - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2
        with:
          arguments: build
          cache-read-only: true

      # Note: Do NOT use secrets in pull_request jobs that run untrusted code
      # If secrets are needed, use a separate trusted workflow triggered by
      # workflow_run or require manual approval
      - name: Run tests (no secrets in untrusted context)
        run: ./gradlew test
