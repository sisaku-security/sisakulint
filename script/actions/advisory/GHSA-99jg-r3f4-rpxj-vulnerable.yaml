      # This advisory is NOT related to GitHub Actions workflows at all.
      # It's a memory overflow vulnerability in the OpenEXR image parsing
      # library used by the openexr-viewer application.
      #
      # The vulnerability is in the C++ code that parses OpenEXR image files,
      # specifically in how it handles malformed image headers, leading to
      # buffer overflows and potential arbitrary code execution.
      #
      # There's no workflow pattern that demonstrates this vulnerability
      # because it's a traditional software vulnerability, not a CI/CD
      # security issue.
